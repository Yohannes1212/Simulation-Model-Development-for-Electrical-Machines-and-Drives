# Rotor Angle and Position Measurement: Modeling and Simulation of Encoder and Encoder-Based Position Detector

## Project Overview
This project, conducted as part of my internship in the African Undergraduate Research Adventure [AURA](https://aura.engin.umich.edu/home) program at the University of Michigan, focuses on developing Simulink models for:
- Incremental encoder simulation.
- Encoder-based position detection and direction identification.
- Integration with electrical drive systems for rotor angle measurement.

## Key Features
- **Incremental Encoder Modeling**: Models the working of an encoder for detecting shaft position and direction.
- **Position Detector**: Implements logic for determining the angular position of a rotor.
- **Simulation Framework**: Developed entirely in MATLAB Simulink, enabling seamless integration into electrical drive systems.
- **Applications**: Electric machines, drives, and control systems.

## Internship Context
- **Institution**: University of Michigan, hosted by Professor Heath Hofmann.
- **Program**: African Undergraduate Research Adventure (AURA) 2020.
- **Duration**: June 1, 2020 â€“ October 2, 2020.

## Files
- **Simulink Models**:
  - `encoder_model.slx`: Simulates the encoder's pulse generation and direction sensing.
  - `encoder_position_detector.slx`: Computes position and direction using encoder signals.
- **Report**: The full internship report is included under the `Report/` directory.

## How to Use
1. Open the `.slx` files in MATLAB Simulink (R2020b or later recommended).
2. Follow instructions in the report for simulation parameters.
3. Adjust input parameters such as rotor angle and direction as needed.
