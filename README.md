# Simulation-Model-Development-for-Electrical-Machines-and-Drives
This project consists of the development of computationally efficient yet accurate Simulink models of electric machines and drives. Nonlinear behavior such as magnetic saturation of the electric machine will be considered. The goal of the models is also to accurately estimate losses and system efficiency of the machine/drive. Potential applications of the developed models are powertrain simulations for electric and hybrid electric vehicles.
